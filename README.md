# Project Structure Overview

This project is organized into three main folders, each serving a distinct purpose:

## 1. Scripts
This folder contains all the scripts used for running classification models. These scripts are crucial for processing the data and applying the machine learning algorithms.

## 2. Data
Located within this folder are the datasets necessary for running the classification models. This includes training data, test data, and any other datasets required by the scripts.

## 3. Jupyter Notebooks and Bash Scripts
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks and bash scripts for downloading accession data. The notebooks provide a step-by-step guide and interactive environment for data retrieval and preliminary analysis. Bash scripts automate the downloading of data from various sources.

Each folder is equipped with its own set of files tailored to specific tasks in the data analysis and model-building pipeline. Ensure that you navigate to the appropriate folder to access the tools and data relevant to your task.
